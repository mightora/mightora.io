## Why Choose Playwright for Power Platform Testing?

Traditional Power Platform testing often requires manual effort and lacks integration with CI/CD pipelines. This extension bridges that gap by providing:

- **Zero Configuration Setup**: Automatically installs and configures the entire Playwright testing environment
- **Power Platform Optimized**: Pre-configured for Power Apps authentication and common testing scenarios  
- **Enterprise Ready**: Designed for Azure DevOps with comprehensive reporting and failure analysis
- **Multi-Browser Coverage**: Test across all major browsers to ensure consistent user experience

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Environment Setup
The extension handles all the complexity of setting up a Playwright testing environment:
- Downloads and installs Node.js if not present
- Clones a specialized Playwright framework designed for Power Platform
- Installs all required npm dependencies and Playwright browsers
- Configures the testing environment with your specific parameters

### 2. Intelligent Test Execution  
- Copies your test files to the configured testing framework
- Sets up environment variables for Power Platform authentication
- Executes tests with your chosen browser configuration
- Captures comprehensive data during test execution

### 3. Advanced Failure Analysis
When tests fail, you get detailed insights:
- **Screenshots**: Visual evidence of exactly what was on screen when tests failed
- **Video Recordings**: Complete recordings of test execution for thorough analysis
- **Trace Files**: Step-by-step execution traces showing every action and its result
- **Network Logs**: HTTP requests and responses to identify connectivity issues
- **Error Extraction**: Specific error messages pulled from test results

### 4. Comprehensive Reporting
Multiple report formats ensure compatibility with your workflow:
- **HTML Reports**: Interactive reports perfect for sharing with stakeholders
- **JSON Results**: Machine-readable results for integration with other tools
- **JUnit XML**: Compatible with most CI/CD reporting systems
- **Screenshots & Videos**: Visual evidence automatically attached to results

## Advanced Task Capabilities

The advanced version of the Playwright for Power Platform task includes additional features for managing user roles, teams, and business units within the Power Platform environment. These capabilities enable:

- **User Role Management**: Assign and remove security roles for users dynamically during test execution.
- **Team Assignment**: Add users to specific teams to test team-based workflows and permissions.
- **Business Unit Configuration**: Update user business units to validate access and functionality across organizational structures.

These features are designed to streamline testing for enterprise-level Power Platform applications, ensuring that user-specific configurations are handled seamlessly within CI/CD pipelines.

## Setup & Configuration

### Prerequisites
- **Windows-based Azure DevOps pipeline agent** (Linux and macOS agents are not supported)
- Power Platform application URL
- Test user credentials with appropriate permissions
- Playwright test files written in JavaScript or TypeScript

### Basic Configuration
1. Ensure your Azure DevOps pipeline uses a **Windows agent** (e.g., `windows-latest`, `windows-2022`, or `vs2017-win2016`)
2. Install the extension in your Azure DevOps organization
3. Add the Playwright for Power Platform task to your pipeline
4. Configure the required parameters:
   - Test location path
   - Target browser(s)  
   - Power Platform app URL
   - Authentication credentials
5. Optionally enable trace mode for detailed debugging

### Example Pipeline YAML
```yaml
# Ensure you're using a Windows agent
pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'

steps:
- task: mightoria-playwrightForPowerPlatform@1
  displayName: 'Run Power Platform Tests'
  inputs:
    testLocation: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/tests'
    browser: 'chromium'
    trace: 'retain-on-failure'
    outputLocation: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/test-results'
    appUrl: 'https://apps.powerapps.com/play/$(AppId)'
    appName: 'MyPowerApp'
    o365Username: '$(TestUser.Email)'
    o365Password: '$(TestUser.Password)'

- task: PublishTestResults@2
  condition: always()
  inputs:
    testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
    testResultsFiles: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/test-results/**/*.xml'
    testRunTitle: 'Power Platform UI Tests'

- task: PublishHtmlReport@1
  condition: always()
  inputs:
    reportDir: '$(Agent.TempDirectory)/test-results/playwright-report'
    tabName: 'Test Report'
```

## Common Test Scenarios

### Authentication Testing
```javascript
test('Office 365 Login Flow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.APP_URL);
  await page.fill('[name="loginfmt"]', process.env.O365_USERNAME);
  await page.click('[type="submit"]');
  await page.fill('[name="passwd"]', process.env.O365_PASSWORD);
  await page.click('[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(new RegExp(process.env.APP_NAME));
});
```

### Canvas App Testing
```javascript
test('Form Submission Workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(process.env.APP_URL);
  // Wait for Power Apps to load
  await page.waitForSelector('[data-automation-id="Canvas"]');
  
  // Interact with Power Apps controls
  await page.click('[aria-label="Name input"]');
  await page.fill('[aria-label="Name input"]', 'Test User');
  await page.click('[aria-label="Submit button"]');
  
  // Verify success message
  await expect(page.locator('[aria-label="Success message"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify credentials and ensure test user has appropriate permissions
- **Element Not Found**: Check for Power Platform loading delays and add appropriate waits
- **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout values for slow-loading Power Platform environments

### Getting Help
- Review the HTML report for detailed execution flow
- Use trace files for step-by-step debugging
- Check screenshots for visual verification of failures
- Visit [mightora.io](https://mightora.io) for additional support

### Best Practices
- Use secret variables for sensitive credentials
- Enable trace mode only when debugging to optimize performance
- Organize tests logically with descriptive names
- Implement proper cleanup procedures for test data
- Use page object patterns for maintainable test code

Transform your Power Platform testing with automated, reliable, and comprehensive end-to-end testing that integrates seamlessly with your Azure DevOps pipelines.
