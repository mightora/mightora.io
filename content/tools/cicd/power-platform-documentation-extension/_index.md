We have also included some other useful tools within the solution such as the **XML Node Updater** and **XML Node Attribute Updater** allowing advanced users to edit a solution within a release pipeline. Alongside this we have included tools which allow you to connect to **Dataverse for Teams** from Azure DevOps allowing ALM and a handy extension allowing for easy commit to repo from a Pipeline.
