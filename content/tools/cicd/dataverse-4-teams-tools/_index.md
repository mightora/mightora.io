## Prerequisites

Before using the Power Platform Dataverse 4 Teams Scripts, ensure you have the following:

- **PowerShell:** Install and configure PowerShell with the ability to run scripts (Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted).
- **Git:** Install Git to manage version control and submodules.
- **Dataverse Environment IDs:** Retrieve both source and target environment IDs from the Power Platform Admin Center.

## Obtaining Credentials

To use the scripts, ensure you have access to the Dataverse environments. Retrieve the environment IDs from the Power Platform Admin Center.

## Supported Operations

The Power Platform Dataverse 4 Teams Scripts support the following operations:

- **Export Solutions:** Automate the export of solutions from Dataverse for Teams environments.
- **Unpack Solutions:** Extract and unpack solutions, including Canvas Apps, into manageable formats.
- **Repack Solutions:** Rebuild previously unpacked solutions for deployment into target environments.
- **Import Solutions:** Import solutions into a specified Dataverse for Teams environment.

## Parameters

### Parameters for Download From Source

- `-solutionName`: The name of the solution to export.
- `-exportDirectory`: Directory where the solution's zip file will be exported.
- `-sourceEnv`: ID of the source environment from which to export the solution.
- `-unpackDirectory`: Directory where the solution will be unpacked and Canvas Apps will be processed.

### Parameters for Release to Target

- `-solutionName`: Name of the solution to be processed.
- `-unpackDirectory`: Directory where the solution is unpacked.
- `-environmentSettingsFile`: (Optional) Path to the environment settings file.
- `-targetEnvironment`: Target environment to which the solution will be imported.
- `-exportDirectory`: Directory where the repacked solution will be exported.
- `-Managed`: Switch to indicate whether the solution should be managed.

## Using the Connector

### Example: Download From Source

This script exports a solution from a source environment, generates a solution settings template, and unpacks the solution, including any Canvas Apps it contains.

```powershell
.\pipelineScripts\downloadFromSource.ps1 -solutionName "Dataverse4TeamsDemo" -exportDirectory ".\demo\dataverse4TeamsDemo" -sourceEnv "1838fca4-6258-e6b8-a710-60838df81aa3" -unpackDirectory ".\demo\dataverse4TeamsDemo\unpacked"
```

### Example: Release to Target

This script re-packs a previously unpacked solution and imports it into a target environment. If an environment settings file is provided, the import will include those settings.

**With a settings file:**

```powershell
.\pipelineScripts\releaseToTarget.ps1 -solutionName "Dataverse4TeamsDemo" -unpackDirectory ".\demo\dataverse4TeamsDemo\unpacked" -exportDirectory ".\demo\dataverse4TeamsDemo" -environmentSettingsFile ".\demo\settings.json" -targetEnvironment "5fc7b0a0-dc6e-e682-8886-bad6dac246a7"
```

**As Managed:**

```powershell
.\pipelineScripts\releaseToTarget.ps1 -solutionName "Dataverse4TeamsDemo" -unpackDirectory ".\demo\dataverse4TeamsDemo\unpacked" -exportDirectory ".\demo\dataverse4TeamsDemo" -environmentSettingsFile ".\demo\settings.json" -targetEnvironment "5fc7b0a0-dc6e-e682-8886-bad6dac246a7" -managed
```
